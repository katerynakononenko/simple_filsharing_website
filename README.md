We added an ability to create  new user. In order to do thta, you need to click on "Create a New User" button on LogIn page and then just create a name for the user. After you click "Add user", you will be returned to the LogIn page, and you will be able to log into a new user with a chosen name. A new directory is made for each new user, so it will allows the upload, delete, viewing files for the new users.
